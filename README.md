# Time Management App

## Web app to help manage your time/schedule

This app has three main functions.

   Use this list to keep track of your tasks. You can add the name of the task, the estimated time it will take, and its level of urgency.
2. Schedule\
   Add the tasks from your checklist to your schedule to keep track of what to do. Once your task ends, you will be prompted whether you finished or if you need more time, in which case you can add the task back into your checklist.
3. Timer\
   A built-in timer for whenever you need it.
