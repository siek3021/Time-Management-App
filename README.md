# Time Management App

## Web app to help manage your time/schedule

This app has three main functions.
1. Checklist\
   Use this list to keep track of your tasks. You can add the name of the task, the time you think it will take you, and the urgency of it.
2. Schedule\
   Add the tasks from your checklist to your schedule to keep track of what to do. Once your task ends, you will be prompted whether you finished or if you need more time, in which case you can add the task back into your checklist.
3. Timer\
   A built-in timer for whenever you need it.

## How to use

First, download all the files from GitHub. Then open the file named "Time_index.html" and the application should open in your default browser.ã€€Once you've opened the app, use the + button on the top right to add/schedule tasks. You can bookmark the link for easy access.

The app works completely offline.
